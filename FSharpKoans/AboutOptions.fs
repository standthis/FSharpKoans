In F#, we tend to use options instead of exceptions for error-handling.

The Option type is a built-in discriminated union that is defined as follows:

type Option<'a> =
| Some of 'a
| None

There are many built-in functions which return an Option.

module ``12: Exploring your options`` =
   (*
      The next function takes in a name and extracts the surname.
      But not all people have surnames!
         
      So, sometimes there is no surname.  But that's completely
      legitimate and understandable: it's not an error, so we
      shouldn't be throwing an exception about it.  We should
      reserve exceptions for actual errors.

      Instead, if someone has a surname, then we return a Some
      value.  Otherwise, we return a None value.  This allows us to
         - Avoid using exceptions for no reason
         - Express the domain that we're modelling more accurately
         - Avoid returning null or "special" values which could be
            misinterpreted later on and/or cause crashes.

    // in the problem domain.  A programmer must remember to check
    // for the -1 value, and if this check is forgotten, then the program
