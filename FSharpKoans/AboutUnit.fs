    When we develop real systems, we often run into problems
    around time and timing.  For example, consider how a web
    browser might work.  It loads images and videos and text
    and all sorts of things on a webpage.  But only a small
    portion of that webpage is visible to a user at a time, and it
    is wasteful (and affects performance!) to pull down an image
    that might never be seen, or to do the work of decoding a
    video which can't be seen by the user.  So, what do we do?
    
    If you think carefully about it, you will realize that this is a
    timing problem.  We don't know what the user will do, and
    we don't know when (if ever!) a particular thing will be
    required.  What we want is a way to *DEFER* work, so that
    it is only done when it needs to be done.

    We can use a ( unit->'a ) function to do this.  The function
    contains the code that *would* be executed to achieve the goal,
    but DOES NOT EXECUTE the code until it is called.  Remember
    that DEFINING a function is not the same as CALLING a function!
    Then, if/when we need to, we can call the function to perform
    the work only when it is necessary to do so.

        Sometimes we want to do something purely for a side-effect
        that it has.  For example, we may want to read a line from a
        file just so that we can get to the next line.  In these cases,
        we use the `ignore` function to throw away a return value.
