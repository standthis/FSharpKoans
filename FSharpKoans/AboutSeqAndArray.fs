    Let's introduce a bit of terminology here:
    - immutable: cannot be changed
    - indexable: can be indexed (e.g., you can say `x.[4]` to get the 5th element of `x`)
    - eager: items are generated when the data structure is created
    - lazy: items are generated on-demand
    - finite: there is necessarily an upper limit on the number of items in the data structure
    - infinite: there is no necessary upper limit on the number of items in the data structure

    Lists are immutable, indexable, eager, finite sequences of a single type.

    Arrays are mutable, indexable, eager, finite sequences of a single type.

    Sequences are immutable, lazy, infinite sequences of a single type.  ALL other
    sequence types, including arrays and lists, can be treated as sequences.
    
    You've already seen List.fold, List.map, List.tryFind, and so on.  Many of these
    functions are also available for sequences and arrays; you'll find Seq.fold, Seq.map,
    Seq.tryFind, etc, and also Array.fold, Array.map, Array.tryFind, etc.  These have
    exactly the same semantics as they do for Lists; they simply operate on different
    data structures.  Note, however, that if you try to do something like find the length
    of an infinite sequence, you'll effectively freeze your program: infinite means infinite.
    The same applies for sorting an infinite sequence and other such operations.

    We can convert between Array, List, and Seq using the following functions:

        - from Array to List: use `List.ofArray` or `Array.toList`
        - from Array to Seq: use `Seq.ofArray` or `Array.toSeq`
        - from List to Array: use `Array.ofList` or `List.toArray`
        - from List to Seq: use `Seq.ofList` or `List.toSeq`
        - from Seq to Array: use `Array.ofSeq` or `Seq.toArray`
        - from Seq to List: use `List.ofSeq` or `Seq.toList`

        Because sequences are potentially infinite, we have some functions to
        make them a bit easier to handle.
        - `Seq.head x` returns the first element of the sequence `x`
        - `Seq.take n x` returns the first `n` elements of the sequence `x`.  It is
          an error to try to take more elements than exist in `x`.
        - `Seq.skip n x` skips the first `n` elements of the sequence `x`, and
          returns the remainder of the sequence.  It is an error to try to skip
          more elements than exist in `x`.

        There are also more interesting Seq functions, such as `takeWhile` and
        so on.  I'll leave it to you to find some of them here:
